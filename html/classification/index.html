<h1 align=center>The CUTE(st) classification scheme</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Each problem in the
<a href="https://github.com/ralna/CUTEst/wiki">CUTEst</a>
test set comes with a simple problem classification. This classification
was inspired by the scheme of Hock and Schittkowski (Test Examples for
Nonlinear Programming Codes, Lectures Notes in Economics and
Mathematical Systems 187, Springer Verlag, 1981).

<p> A problem is classified by the string
<pre>
   <b>XXXr-XX-n-m</b>
</pre>
This string must not contain any blanks.
In what follows, we state the admissible letters and integers,
together with their
interpretation, for each character in the classification string.
Note that all letters must be given in upper case.

<p>
The first character  in the string   defines the type   of the problem
objective function.  Possible values are:

<p>
<ol>
<dl>
<dt> <b>N </b>  no objective function is defined,
<dt> <b>C </b>  the objective function is constant,
<dt> <b>L </b>  the objective function is linear,
<dt> <b>Q </b>  the objective function is quadratic,
<dt> <b>S </b>  the objective function is a sum of squares, and
<dt> <b>O </b>  the objective function is none of the above.
</dl>
</ol>

<p>
The second character in the string defines the type of constraints of
the problem. Possible values are:

<p>
<ol>
<dl>
<dt> <b>U </b>  the problem is unconstrained,
<dt> <b>X </b>  the problem's only constraints are fixed variables,
<dt> <b>B </b>  the problem's only constraints are bounds on the variables,
<dt> <b>N </b>  the problem's constraints represent the adjacency matrix of
a (linear) network,
<dt> <b>L </b>  the problem's constraints are linear,
<dt> <b>Q </b>  the problem's constraints are quadratic, and
<dt> <b>O </b>  the problem's constraints are more general than any of the
above alone.
</dl>
</ol>

<p>
The third character in the string indicates the smoothness of the
problem. There are two choices:

<p>
<ol>
<dl>
<dt> <b>R </b>  the problem is regular, that is its first and second
derivatives exist and are continuous everywhere, or
<dt> <b>I </b>  the problem is irregular.
</dl>
</ol>

<p>
The integer (<b>r</b>)  which corresponds to the fourth  character  of the
string is the degree of the highest derivatives provided analytically
within the problem description.
It is restricted to being one of the single characters <tt>0</tt>, <tt>1</tt>
or <tt>2</tt>.

<p>
The  character immediately following the first hyphen indicates the
primary origin and/or interest of the problem.
Possible values are:

<p>
<ol>
<dl>
<dt> <b>A </b>  the problem is academic, that is, has been constructed
specifically by researchers to test one or more algorithms,
<dt> <b>M </b>  the problem is part of a modelling exercise where the actual
      value of the solution is not used in a genuine practical application, and
<dt> <b>R </b>  the problem's solution is (or has been) actually used in a
real application for purposes other than testing algorithms.
</dl>
</ol>

<p>
The next character in the string indicates whether or not the problem
description contains explicit
<a href="../sif//node3.html#SECTION00021000000000000000"> internal variables</a>.
There are two possible values, namely

<p>
<ol>
<dl>
<dt> <b>Y </b>  the problem description contains explicit internal variables, or
<dt> <b>N </b>  the problem description does not contain any explicit internal
variables.
</dl>
</ol>

<p>
The symbol(s) between the second and  third hyphen indicate the number
of variables in the problem.  Possible values are

<p>
<ol>
<dl>
<dt> <b>V </b>  the number of variables in the problem can be chosen by the
user, or
<dt> <b>n </b>  a positive integer giving the actual (fixed) number of problem
variables.
</dl>
</ol>

<p>
The symbol(s) after the third hyphen indicate the number of
constraints (other than fixed variables and bounds) in the problem.
Note that fixed variables are not considered as general constraints here.
The two possible values are

<p>
<ol>
<dl>
<dt> <b>V </b>  the number of constraints in the problem can be chosen by the
user, or
<dt> <b>m </b>  a nonnegative integer giving the actual (fixed) number of
problem constraints.
</dl>
</ol>

</ul>
