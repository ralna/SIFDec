3.1.4 An Example
</H3>

<P>
Before we  give the complete  syntax for   an  SDIF file,  we give  an
illustrative  example. In  order   to exhibit as  many constructs   as
possible,   we consider    how  we  might    encode  the example    in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#S1.6">2.5</A>.   We   urge the reader to   study this section  in
detail.   As  always, there  are  many possible  ways of specifying  a
particular problem; we give one  in Figures&nbsp;<A HREF="node13.html#Fig2">3.1</A> and <A HREF="node13.html#Fig3">3.2</A>,
pages&nbsp;<A HREF="node13.html#Fig2"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/local/lib/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A> and <A HREF="node13.html#Fig3"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/local/lib/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A>.
The horizontal and vertical lines  are merely included to indicate the
extent of data fields. The  actual  widths of the fields
are given at the top  of the figure,  and the  column numbers given at
its foot.

<P>
The SDIF file naturally  divides into two  parts.   In the first part,
lines 2  to 39 of the figure, we specify  information regarding linear
functions used in the example.
In the second part,  lines 40 to 93, we specify nonlinear  information.
The first part  is merely an extension  of  the MPS
input format; the second part is new.

<P>
The file must always start with a <TT>NAME</TT>
card, on which a name (in this case <TT>EG3</TT>) for the example  may be
given (line 1), and must end with an <TT>ENDATA</TT>
card (line  93).
A comment is inserted  at the end  of line 1  as to the  source of the
example.  The character <TT>$</TT> identifies  the remainder of the line
as a comment; the comment is ignored when interpreting the input file.

<P>
We next specify  names of parameters
which will occur   frequently in
specifying the example  (lines 2 to 5).  In our case the integer and
real parameters
<TT>1</TT> and <TT>ONE</TT> are given along with  <TT>N</TT>, a
problem dimension  -- here  <TT>N</TT> is set to  100,  but it would  be
trivial to change  the example  in  6  to allow  variables   <!-- MATH
 $x_1
,\ldots, x_n$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="69" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img187.png"
 ALT="$ x_1
,\ldots, x_n$"> for any <IMG
 WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="8" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img188.png"
 ALT="$n$">.  We make a comment  to this effect on
line 4; any card with the character <TT>*</TT> in column  1  is a  comment card
and its content is ignored when interpreting the input file.

<P>
We now name the problem variables
and groups
(in our example objective function and constraints)
used. The groups may  be specified before or
after  the variables. We  choose here to name  the   groups first.
The  objective  function
will  be known as   <TT>OBJ</TT> (line  7); the
character <TT>N</TT> in  field 1 specifies  that  this is  an  objective
function    group.
The  inequality constraints    (<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.2">2.19</A>)
and (<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.3">2.20</A>) are  named <!-- MATH
 ${\tt CONLE1},\ldots,  {\tt CONLE99}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img189.png"
 ALT="${\tt CONLE1},\ldots, {\tt CONLE99}$"> and
<!-- MATH
 ${\tt CONGE1},\ldots,  {\tt CONGE100}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="153" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img190.png"
 ALT="${\tt CONGE1},\ldots, {\tt CONGE100}$"> respectively.  Rather   than
specify them individually, a do-loop
is used to make an array
definition.  Thus the constraints
<!-- MATH
 ${\tt CONLE1,\ldots, CONLE99}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img191.png"
 ALT="${\tt CONLE1,\ldots, CONLE99}$"> are defined <EM>en masse</EM>
on lines 9  to  11 with  the do-loop  index  <TT>I</TT>  running from the
previously defined  value <IMG
 WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img192.png"
 ALT="$1$"> to the  value  <TT>NM1</TT>.   The integer
parameter, <TT>NM1</TT>,
is defined on line 8 to be the sum of <TT>N</TT> and the value
<IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="10" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img193.png"
 ALT="${\tt -1}$"> and in our case will  be 99.   The characters  <TT>XL</TT>
in field 1 of line 10 indicate that an  array
definition is being made
(the  <IMG
 WIDTH="8" HEIGHT="10" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img194.png"
 ALT="${\tt X}$">)    and  that the   groups
are less-than-or-equal-to
constraints
(the <TT>L</TT>).  The do-loop introduced on  line 9 with the
characters <TT>DO</TT>
in  field 1 is  terminated on  line 11  with  the
characters <TT>ND</TT>
in   its    first field.  In  a   similar  way,  the constraints <!-- MATH
 ${\tt CONGE1,\ldots, CONGE99}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img195.png"
 ALT="${\tt CONGE1,\ldots, CONGE99}$"> are defined all  together on lines 12 to  14;
that these constraints involve  bounds
on  both sides is taken care of
by considering  them to  be greater-than-or-equal-to constraints
(<TT>XG</TT>)
on  line  13 and later  specifying the additional upper bounds in
the <TT>RANGES</TT>
section  (lines 26 to  29).  Finally,
the equality constraint (<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.4">2.21</A>)
is to be  called <TT>CONEQ</TT> (line 15); the character   <TT>E</TT>
in   field  1 specifies that this  is  an equality constraint group.

<P>
Having named the groups,
we  next name the  problem variables.
At the
same time,  we include the  coefficients  of  all  the linear elements
used.  The variables are named  <!-- MATH
 ${\tt X1},\ldots, {\tt X100}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="86" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img196.png"
 ALT="${\tt X1},\ldots, {\tt X100}$"> and <TT>Y</TT>; an array
declaration is made for the former set on  lines 17 to 19
and <TT>Y</TT> is defined on line 20. The character <TT>X</TT> in field 1 of
line 18 indicates that an array definition is used. Only the objective
function
(<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.1">2.18</A>), inequality  constraint
(<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.2">2.19</A>) and equality
constraint  groups
(<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.4">2.21</A>)  contain  linear  elements.
As well as
introducing  <TT>Y</TT>, line  20 also specifies  that the linear element
associated with group <TT>OBJ</TT> (field  3) involves variable  <TT>Y</TT>,
and that <TT>Y</TT> 's coefficient in the linear element
is  1.0 (field 4).  A do-loop
is now used in lines 21 to 23  to  show that the linear
elements  for constraints (<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.2">2.19</A>) also use  the  variable <TT>Y</TT>.
It is assumed  that unless a variable is  explicitly identified with a
linear element,  the element is  independent of that variable.   Thus,
although  (<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.4">2.21</A>) uses  a linear element,  the element is constant
and need not be specified in the <TT>VARIABLES</TT>
section.

<P>
The only remaining part of the linear elements
which must be specified
is the constant term. Again, only nonzero constants need be given. For
our  example, only  the  equality constraint
group
(<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.4">2.21</A>) has a
nonzero constant term and  this data is specified on  lines 24 and 25.
The string  <TT>C1</TT> in  field 2 of  line 25 is  the   name given to a
specific set of constants. In general,  more  than one set of constants
may be specified in  the SDIF file and the  relevant one selected in a
postprocessing stage. Here, of course, we only have one set.

<P>
As   we have seen, the  inequality   constraint groups (<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.3">2.20</A>) are
bounded from above as well as from  below. In the <TT>RANGES</TT>
section (lines 26 to  30)  we  specify  these  upper bounds (or  range
constraints  as  they are  sometimes  known).
The  numerical  values
<!-- MATH
 ${\scriptstyle \frac{1}{2}}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img197.png"
 ALT="${\scriptstyle \frac{1}{2}}$"> are specified for each bound  for the relevant groups
in an array
definition on line 28; the string <TT>R1</TT> in field 2 is once
again a name
given to a specific set of range values as it is possible
to define more than one set in the <TT>RANGES</TT> section.

<P>
We now turn to the simple  bounds
(<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.5">2.22</A>) which are  specified in
lines 30 to 36 of the example.   All problem variables  are assumed to
have  lower  bounds  of zero and   no upper  bounds  unless  otherwise
specified.  All but one  of the variables  for our  example have lower
bounds of <IMG
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img198.png"
 ALT="$-1$">. We  thus change the default
value for the value of the lower bound on line 31 - the set of bounds
is named <TT>BND1</TT>.  The  character <TT>L</TT>
specifies that  it is the lower  bound
default that  is to be changed.
The string <TT>'DEFAULT'</TT>
in field 3 indicates that the default is  being changed.  The variable
<IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img199.png"
 ALT="$x_i$"> is given an upper bound
of <IMG
 WIDTH="5" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img200.png"
 ALT="$i$">. We encode  that in a do-loop on
lines  32 to  35 of  the figure.  The  do-loop  index <TT>I</TT>   is  an
integer.  We change its current value to a real on line 33  and assign
that value  as the upper bound
on  line 34.  The  character <TT>Z</TT> in
field 1 of this line indicates that an  array
definition is being made
and that the data is taken from a parameter in field 5 (as  opposed to
a specified numerical   value in field   4) and the character  <TT>U</TT>
specifies that the upper bound
value is to  be assigned.  The variable
<TT>y</TT> is unbounded  or,  as   it  is   often known,  free.
This  is specified on line 36, the  string <TT>FR</TT>
in field  1 indicating that <TT>Y</TT> is free.

<P>
The final ``linear'' piece of information given is an estimate  of the
solution to the problem (if known) or  at  least a set of  values from
which to start a minimization  algorithm. This information is given on
lines  37  to  39. For  our problem,   we  choose  the  values  <!-- MATH
 $x_i =
{\scriptstyle \frac{1}{2}},  1  \leq  i  \leq  100$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 WIDTH="38" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img202.png"
 ALT="$y = 0$">.  Unless otherwise
specified, all starting values take a default of zero.
We change that
default on line 38 to <!-- MATH
 ${\scriptstyle \frac{1}{2}}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img203.png"
 ALT="${\scriptstyle \frac{1}{2}}$"> -- the set of starting values are
named  <TT>START1</TT> --  and then specify the individual  value for the
variable <TT>Y</TT> on line 39.

<P>
We now specify the nonlinear information.
<IMG HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="new.gif">
Firstly, we recall that
there is a quadratic objective group,
<!-- MATH
 $x_1^2 + 2 x_1^{ } x_{100}^{ } \equiv {\scriptstyle \frac{1}{2}}( 4 x_1 x_1 +
 2 x_1 x_{100} + 2 x_{100} x_1 )$

2 x_1 x_{100} + 2 x_{100} x_1 )$">. We need to specify the nonzero coefficients
of the terms <IMG
 WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img205.png"
 ALT="$x_j x_k$">, and in our cases these are
<IMG

 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img207.png"
 ALT="$h_{1,100} = h_{100,1} = 2$">.
The rule that we adopt is
that there is no need to supply both nonzeros
<IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img208.png"
 ALT="$h_{j,k}$"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img209.png"
 ALT="$h_{k,j}$"> since they are the same, and
that one (whichever is unimportant) suffices. Thus <IMG
 WIDTH="56" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img210.png"
 ALT="$h_{1,1} = 4$">
and we (arbitrarily) choose to give <IMG
 WIDTH="69" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img211.png"
 ALT="$h_{1,100} = 2$">.
In the <TT>QUADRATIC</TT> section on lines 39a to 39b, we indicate that
the quadratic objective has two terms involving
<IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="10" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img212.png"

 SRC="img214.png"
 ALT="${x_1 x_{100}}$"> term is assigned the value 2.
<IMG HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="new.gif">

<P>
Next, we saw in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#S1.6">2.5</A>
that there are four element types
for  the problem, being of  the form
(i) <!-- MATH
 $(v_1 - v_2 ) v_3$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img215.png"
 ALT="$(v_1 - v_2 ) v_3$">, (ii) <IMG
 WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img216.png"
 ALT="$p_1 v_1 v_2$">, (iii) <IMG
 WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img217.png"
 ALT="$\sin v_1$"> and (iv)
<!-- MATH
 $(v_1 + v_2  )^2$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="67" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img218.png"
 ALT="$(v_1 + v_2 )^2$">.  In  the <TT>ELEMENT  TYPE</TT>
section on lines 40 to 48, we record details  of these types.  We name
the four  types (i)-(iv) <TT>3PROD,  2PROD, SINE</TT>  and  <TT>SQUARE</TT>
respectively.   For  <TT>3PROD</TT>,  we define  the elemental  variables
(lines 41  and 42) to be <TT>V1, V2</TT>  and <TT>V3</TT>  and the internal
variables (line 43) to be <TT>U1</TT> and  <TT>U2</TT>.  Elemental variables
may be defined, two to a line, on lines for which field 1 is <TT>EV</TT>.
Internal variables,
on the other hand, are defined on lines  with <TT>IV</TT>  in field 1.  Similar definitions  are  made for <TT>2PROD</TT> (line
44), <TT>SINE</TT> (line 46)  and <TT>SQUARE</TT> (line  47). The type <TT>2PROD</TT> also makes use of a parameter <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img219.png"
 ALT="$p_1$">. This is named <TT>P1</TT>
on line 45 for which field 1 reads <TT>EP</TT>.

<P>
Having   specified the  element  types,
we  next   specify individual
nonlinear elements
in the <TT>ELEMENT USES</TT>
section.  As we have seen, the objective function
group uses  a single
nonlinear element of type
<TT>3PROD</TT>. We name this particular element
<TT>OBJ1</TT>.  On line 50,  the character <TT>T</TT>  in field 1 indicates
that the <TT>OBJ1</TT> is of type  <TT>3PROD</TT>. The assignment of problem
to  elemental variables
is made on  lines  51 to 53. Problem variables
<TT>X1</TT> and <TT>X2</TT> are assigned to elemental variables <TT>V1</TT> and
<TT>V3</TT>; the assignment  is  indicated by the   character <TT>V</TT>  in
field 1.  In order to assign <IMG
 WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img220.png"
 ALT="$x_{100}$"> (or in general <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img221.png"
 ALT="$x_n$">) to <IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="10" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img222.png"
 ALT="$v_2$">,
we assign the array
entry <TT>X(N)</TT>  to <TT>V2</TT>. Notice  that as an
array element is being used, this must be specially flagged  (<TT>ZV</TT>
in field 1) as otherwise the wrong variable (called <TT>X(N)</TT> rather
than <TT>X100</TT>, which is  the expanded form of  <TT>X(N)</TT>) would be
assigned.   There are two   nonlinear  elements
for   each inequality
constraint group
(<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.2">2.19</A>), each being of  the same type  <TT>2PROD</TT>. We  name these
elements
<!-- MATH
 ${\tt CLEA1,\ldots,  CLEA99}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img223.png"
 ALT="${\tt CLEA1,\ldots, CLEA99}$"> and    <!-- MATH
 ${\tt CLEB1,\ldots,
CLEB99}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img224.png"
 ALT="${\tt CLEB1,\ldots,
CLEB99}$">. The assignments are made on lines 54 to 67 within a do-loop.
On lines 56 and 60  the elements are named
and their  types assigned.

<P>
As array
assignments are being used,  field 1 for  both lines contains
the string <TT>XT</TT>.
The elemental variables
are then associated with
problem variables
on lines 57-58 and 61-62 respectively. Again array
assignments are used and field 1 contains the string <TT>ZV</TT>.
Notice  that   on  line 58 <IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="10" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img225.png"
 ALT="$v_2$"> is  assigned  the  problem variable
<IMG
 WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img226.png"
 ALT="$x_{i+1}$">, where the  index <TT>IP1</TT> is   defined as  the sum of  the
index <TT>I</TT>  and  the integer  value 1  on line  55.  It remains  to
assign values    for the parameter <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img227.png"
 ALT="$p_1$"> for   each element.
This is
straightforward for the elements  <!-- MATH
 ${\tt CLEA1,\ldots, CLEA99}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img228.png"
 ALT="${\tt CLEA1,\ldots, CLEA99}$"> as the
required value is always 1 and the assignment is made on  line 59 on a
card
with first field <TT>XP</TT>.
The  remaining elements  have varying parameter
values <IMG
 WIDTH="48" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img229.png"
 ALT="${1 + 2/i}$">.
This value is  calculated on lines  63 to 65 and  assigned on line 66.
Line 63 assigns  <TT>REALI</TT> to have  the  floating point value of the
index <TT>I</TT>.  This  new value is then divided  into the value  2  on
line 64 and the value assigned to <TT>ONE</TT>  is added to the resulting
value on  the final line.  Thus  the parameter
<TT>2OVAI+1</TT> holds the
required value of <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img230.png"
 ALT="$p_1$"> and the  array
assignment is  made on line 66.
On this line the string <TT>ZP</TT> indicates that an array
assignment is
being made, taking its value from the parameter  <TT>2OVAI+1</TT> in field
4 (the <TT>Z</TT>) and that the elemental parameter
<TT>P1</TT> in field 3
is to  be assigned (the  <TT>P</TT>).  The  definition of the  nonlinear
elements for the remaining constraint
groups is straightforward. The inequality constraints
(<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.3">2.20</A>) each
use a single element, named
<!-- MATH
 ${\tt CGE1,\ldots,  CGE100}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="119" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img231.png"
 ALT="${\tt CGE1,\ldots, CGE100}$">, of type <TT>SINE</TT>  and the appropriate  array
assignments are made on  lines 68 to
70.  Finally, the equality constraint
(<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.4">2.21</A>) is  named <TT>CEQ1</TT>
and typed <TT>SQUARE</TT> with appropriate elemental variable
assignments on lines 72 to 74.

<P>
We next need to specify  the nontrivial group  types.
This is done in
the  <TT>GROUP   TYPE</TT>
section  on   lines   75   to 77.  We  saw in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#S1.6">2.5</A>    that  a    single nontrivial   group,  <IMG
 WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img232.png"
 ALT="$p_1
\alpha^2$">, is required. On  line 76, the  name <TT>PSQUARE</TT> is given
for the type and the group type variable <IMG
 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="8" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img233.png"
 ALT="${\tt\alpha}$"> is named <IMG
 WIDTH="47" HEIGHT="10" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img234.png"
 ALT="${\tt ALPHA.}$"> The string <TT>GV</TT>
pin field 1 indicates that a type  and its
variable are to be defined. On the following line field 1  is <TT>GP</TT>
and this is used to announce that the group type parameter
<IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img235.png"
 ALT="$p_1$"> is named <TT>P1</TT>.

<P>
Finally, we need to allocate nonlinear elements
to groups
and specify
what type the resulting groups are to  be. This takes place within the
<TT>GROUP USES</TT>
section which runs from line 78 to 90.  The objective
function group is nontrivial and its type is announced on line 79. The
group uses  the single nonlinear element
<TT>OBJ1</TT> specified on line
80    and the  group-type   parameter
<IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img236.png"
 ALT="$p_1$"> is   set   to the  value
<!-- MATH
 ${\scriptstyle \frac{1}{2}}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="6" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img237.png"
 ALT="${\scriptstyle \frac{1}{2}}$"> on  the next line. The  characters <TT>T</TT>,  <TT>E</TT> and
<TT>P</TT>
in the  first  fields  of these three  cards
announce their
purposes.  The inequality groups  (<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.2">2.19</A>) each use   two nonlinear
elements,
but the groups themselves are trivial
(and  thus their types
do not have to be made  explicit). The assignment of  the  elements to
each group is made in an  array
definition on lines 82  to 84; line 83
is flagged  as assigning elements to a  group with the string <TT>XE</TT>
in field 1. The  second set of  inequality constraints
(<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.3">2.20</A>) use
the nontrivial group type <TT>PSQUARE</TT> with parameter  value 1.
Each group  uses a  single  nonlinear  element
and  the   appropriate array
assignments  are contained   on lines 85    to 89. Lastly  the trivial
equality  constraint   group  (<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.4">2.21</A>)  is assigned the   nonlinear
element <TT>CEQ1</TT> on line 90.

<P>
The definition of the problem is now complete. However, it often helps
the intended minimization program if known  lower and  upper bounds on
the possible values  of the objective function
can  be given.   For  our example,  the objective function (<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.1">2.18</A>)
cannot be smaller than zero. This  data is  specified on lines  91 and
92.  The string <TT>LO</TT>
in field  1 of line 92 indicates  that a lower bound
is known for the
value of (<A HREF="node7.html#1.6.1">2.18</A>).  The string <TT>OBOUND</TT> in field&nbsp;2 of this line
is a name given to this known bound. The value of  the lower bound now
follows in field&nbsp;4.  No upper bound need be specified as  the function
is initially assumed to lie between plus and minus infinity.
