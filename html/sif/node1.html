1 Introduction
</H1>

<P>
The mathematical   modelling of many real-world  applications involves
the  minimization or maximization of  a function of unknown parameters
or   variables.   Frequently   these  parameters   have known  bounds;
sometimes there are more general relationships between the parameters.
When the number of variables is  modest,  say up  to ten, the input of
such  a   problem to  an  optimization procedure  is    usually fairly
straightforward. Unfortunately many application areas  now require the
solution of optimization problems with thousands of variables; in this
case merely the input of the problem data  is extremely time-consuming
and prone to error. Moreover,  the mathematical programming  community
is only now designing algorithms for solving problems of this scale.

<P>
The format described in this report
was motivated directly by the  difficulties the authors were
experiencing entering test examples to the <I>LANCELOT</I> large-scale
nonlinear optimization  package.  It soon    became apparent  that  if
others  were to  be  encouraged to carry  out similar  tests  and even
enticed to use our software, the process of specifying problems had to
be considerably simplified. Thus we were inevitably drawn to provide a
preliminary   version of what   is described here:
a standard input format  (SIF) for nonlinear programming
problems, together with an appropriate translator from the  input file
to  the form required  by the  authors'  minimization software.  While
understandably reflecting   our views  and   experience, the   present
proposal is intended to be broadly applicable.

<P>
During the subsequent (and successive)  stages of development of these
preliminary ideas,  various important considerations  were  discussed.
These strongly influenced the present proposal.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>There are many  reasons for  proposing  a standard input  format.  The
most obvious  one  is  the increased consistency    in  coding
nonlinear programming problems, and the resulting improvement  in code
reliability. As every problem is treated in a similar and standardized
way, it is more difficult to  overlook  certain aspects of the problem
definition.  The  provision of a SIF  file for a given  problem also
allows some  elementary (and very  often helpful) automatic  error and
consistency checking.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A  further advantage of   having a standard input format   is the long
awaited  possibility  of having  a  portable  testbed   of  meaningful
problems.  Moreover,  such a testbed that  can  be  expected  to grow.  The
authors  soon experienced  the daunting   difficulties associated with
specifying large  scale  problems --  not  only the   difficulty  of
writing down  the specification correctly but also  the  actual coding
(and frequent  re-coding) of a particular problem  which often results
in non-trivial differences between the initial and  final data.  These
differences could be a   major obstacle to  valid comparisons  between
competing optimization codes.  By contrast, having a SIF file allows
simple and unambiguous data transfer via  diskette, tape or electronic
mail. The success of the NETLIB and Harwell/Boeing problem collections
for linear  programming and sparse linear algebra   [<A
 HREF="node57.html#Gay85">9</A>,<A
 HREF="node57.html#DuffGrimLewi89">6</A>]
  is a  good   recommendation  for  such
flexibility.   The  formality  required   by  the  SIF   approach may
admittedly appear formidable  for very simple  problems,  but is  soon
repaid when dealing with more complex ones.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Of course, the SIF format should cover a large  part of the practical
optimization  problems  that users  may   want  to specify.   Explicit
provision should be made not only for unconstrained problems, but also
for constraints of different types  and complexity: simple  bounds  on
the variables,
linear  and/or  nonlinear  equations and  inequalities
should be handled without trouble. Special structure
of the problem at
hand is  also a  mandatory  part of  an  SIF  file. For example,  the
structure   of  least-squares
problems must  be   described  in  an
exploitable   form.   Sparsity
of  relevant  matrices  and   partial separability
of involved  nonlinear functions must be  included in the
standard problem   description   when  they  are known.   Finally, the
special case of systems of nonlinear equations should also be covered.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The  existence and worldwide success of  the MPS standard input format
for linear programming  must be considered as  a <EM>de facto</EM> basis
for any attempt to define an  SIF for  nonlinear problems. The number
of  problems already  available  in this format   is  large,  and many
nonlinear problems arise as a refinement of existing linear ones whose
linear part and sparsity
structure are expected to be described in the
MPS
format. It therefore seems reasonable to require that an  SIF for
nonlinear programming problems  should conform to  the  MPS format. We
were thus led to choose a  standard that  corresponds to MPS,
augmented with  additional  constructs and  structures,  thus allowing
nonlinearity, and the general features that we wished, to be described
properly.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The requirement of compatibility with the MPS format  has a  number of
consequences, not all of which are pleasant. The first one is that the
new SIF must  be based on  fixed format
for the SIF file.  Indeed, blanks
are  significant characters in MPS,
when they appear in the right data fields,
and  cannot be used as general  separators for free format
input in any compatible  system.  The second one  is the <EM>a
priori</EM>  existence of  a ``style'' for keywords  and overall layout of
the problem  description, a format which is  not always ideally suited
to  nonlinear problems.   Our   present proposal  accepts  these
limitations.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The SIF should not be dependent on  a specific operating system and/or
manufacturer. In this respect, it must avoid relying on tools that may
be excellent but are too specific (yacc and lex, for example). This of
course does not prevent any implementation of an SIF interpreter using
whatever facilities are locally available.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In principle,  the SIF should  not be dependent on  a particular high
level programming language. However,   as the intention  is that  SIF
files may  be converted into  executable programs, restrictions on the
symbolic  names   allowed  by   different  programming   languages may
influence the choice of names  within the problem  description itself.
For  instance, in Fortran,
symbolic   variables  may only  contain up  to   six characters from a
restricted set.  We  have chosen  to base the present proposal,  where
necessary, on Fortran
as  this appears to  be the most restrictive  of the more popular high
level languages.   This  dependence has  been isolated  as    much  as
possible.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The   authors are very  well  aware of the  shortcomings  of the  SIF
approach when compared to more elaborate modelling languages
(see, for
example, GAMS [<A
 HREF="node57.html#GAMS88">1</A>],
AMPL [<A
 HREF="node57.html#FourGayKern87">7</A>],
and OMP [<A
 HREF="node57.html#OMP87">4</A>].
These probably remain the best way to allow easy  and error free input
of large  problems. However, we contend   that there is  at present no
language  in   the public   domain which   satisfactorily handles  the
nonlinear aspects  of mathematical  programming  problems.   While the
advent  of  a  tool of   this   nature  is  very much   hoped  for, it
nevertheless seems necessary  to provide something like  the SIF now.
This  (we  hope,  intermediate)  step  is    indeed crucial  for   the
development   and comparison  of  algorithms for   solving large scale
nonlinear problems,   without  which a  more   elaborate tool would be
meaningless   anyway.  The SIF   for nonlinear problems   may also be
considered as a  first attempt to specify  the minimal structures
that
should be present in a true modelling  language
for such problems. It
is also of interest to develop a relatively simple input format, given
that   researchers  developing new  optimization   methods may have to
implement  their own code  for translating the  SIF file into  a form
suitable for their algorithms.  At this level, some compromise between
completeness and simplicity  seems necessary.  Finally,  the existence
and availability of modelling languages
for linear programming
for  a number of years has not yet made the MPS
format irrelevant.

<P>
Hence,  the reader  should   be aware   that what  sometimes appear as
unnecessarily restrictive  ``features'' of  the proposed  standard are
often direct consequences of the considerations outlined above.

<P>
In the next section, we explain how we propose to exploit the
structure in problems of the form
(<A HREF="node2.html#objective">2.1</A>)-(<A HREF="node2.html#inequality_constraints">2.4</A>) . We do this
both in  general and for a number of examples. Details of
the  way such  structure
may be expressed in  a standard data input
format  follow  in Section&nbsp;3. The  input of nonlinear  information for
element  and group  functions
is  covered  in Section&nbsp;4 and Section&nbsp;5
respectively.  The formats proposed  in Sections&nbsp;3-5 are quite rigid.
A  more flexible,  free-form,
input is considered  in  Section&nbsp;6.  The relationship to existing work
is presented in Section&nbsp;7 and conclusions drawn in Section&nbsp;7.
